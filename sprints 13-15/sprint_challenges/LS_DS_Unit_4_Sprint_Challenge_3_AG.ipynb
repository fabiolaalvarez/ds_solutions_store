If in the next five years, we see more companies opening up to that bigger picture and seeing that data is in everything, I think we can see a lot more of almost a \"democracy\" in our companies. By using data from your customers, you can see what works and what doesn't. What contributes to how customers spend or how they are going to react to specific products, etc. If this becomes more standardized, imagine what the voice of the public could do...
